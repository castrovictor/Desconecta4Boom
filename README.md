# Desconecta4Boom
Project for my course in Artificial Intelligence in the University of Granada. 
The projects consits in an algoritihm to plau automatically the game Desconecta4Boom, which is a modified version of Connect 4 game. 
The alphaâ€“beta pruning for minimax algoritihm is used to create the artificial intelligence. 

The instructions are in the resources folder. We were required to implement the alpha-beta prunning for the minimax algorithm as well as
design a heuristic function for the algorithim. The GUI was provided by the professors. My work can be found in the files "player.cpp"
and "player.h"
